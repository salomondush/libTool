## libTool

This webtool helps in classifying information about scanned books in libraries mainly for error correction, wrong order, and wrong location. So far, it is being used by Vanderbilt University Central library, Sarah Shannon Stevenson Science & Engineering Library, and the Divinity library. All data is open for public access, except adding and viewing files.

You can navigate the link below of the actual website [libTool](https://valibtool.uc.r.appspot.com/)

## Using
  
 # viewing
 - On the landing page Select a specific library and submit
 - Now, you'll see a dashboard representing all sorts of classifications of scanned books
 # adding books (admin)
 - You need to be granted access to this feature 
 - Data about scanned books is uploaded in form of a csv file, so before uploading, make sure that it's a csv file and that the BarCode column of the books is not in scientific notation
 - Navigate to the add files link on the side navbar, upload the file, choose the file's date, upload the file, and allow the website to process it
 - After it's done, you'll be redirected to the dashboard, which will include the newly uploaded data.
